# My portfolio built with Sveltekit

The site is hosted on my Linux server and serves https with SSL certificate.
Using NodeJs Express as a proxy server to serve both the portfolio and the SSL.

Using [@sveltejs/adapter-node](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-node '@sveltejs/adapter-node') in production.
